## üéØ Document Purpose

This is the **technical build reference** - separate from the formal proposal. Use these docs when:
- Setting up your development environment
- Implementing specific features
- Making architectural decisions
- Onboarding new developers
- Reviewing code and standards

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start here**: [00-Quick-Start.md](00-Quick-Start.md)
2. **Understand the system**: [01-Architecture.md](01-Architecture.md)
3. **Plan your work**: [03-Development-Phases.md](03-Development-Phases.md)
4. **Start building**: Follow phase-specific implementation guides

---

## üìù How to Use These Docs

Each document is **self-contained** and focused on a specific topic. Documents reference each other where relevant but can be read independently.

**For solo developers**: Read in sequence, implement phase by phase  
**For teams**: Distribute docs by role (backend devs ‚Üí API/DB, frontend devs ‚Üí Components, ML engineers ‚Üí AI/ML)  
**For contributors**: Start with Architecture, Code Standards, and the specific feature you're working on

---

## üîÑ Living Documentation

These documents should be updated as:
- Architecture decisions change
- New features are added
- Implementation details are refined
- Lessons are learned during development

**Maintenance**: Keep docs in sync with code. When you change code, update docs.

## üìÇ Related Documents

- **[Proposal Document](../poss-i-analysis-platform-proposal.md)** - Formal proposal for Dr. Bruehl
- **[App Names List](../app-names.md)** - Potential names for the platform

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Keep each file focused on one topic
2. Use consistent formatting (headers, code blocks, tables)
3. Include practical examples
4. Cross-reference related documents
5. Update this index
