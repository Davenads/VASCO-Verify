## Overview

This platform enables independent verification of groundbreaking research linking astronomical transients with nuclear weapons testing and UAP reports. Using AI-powered detection (YOLOv8) combined with manual verification, researchers can reproduce published findings from *Nature Scientific Reports*.

**Key Features:**
- Upload and analyze POSS-I FITS files
- AI-powered transient detection using YOLOv8
- Manual verification interface with catalog cross-matching
- Statistical analysis and correlation tools
- Export results for further research

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Davenads/VASCO-Verify.git
cd VASCO-Verify
```

2. **Copy environment configuration:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Start the application:**
```bash
make up
```

Or using docker-compose directly:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. **Access the application:**

### First-Time Setup

Initialize the database:
```bash
# Using Docker
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Or run the init script
python scripts/init_db.py
```

## Scientific Context

This platform is based on research published in *Scientific Reports* (Nature) that identified:
- 107,875 transients in POSS-I images
- 45% increase in transients within Â±1 day of nuclear tests
- 8.5% increase per additional UAP report
- Statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05)
